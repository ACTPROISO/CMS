# EmoCms
I am making a CMS / Blog, a plattform for people to share their open-minded thoughts and also their emotions, a place for people who wanna open up to the world and express themselves.

Things I learned:
- RESTful APIS
- MVC Pattern 
- Node JS
- Async Await
- Express
- Authentication
- Validation
- Making it live on heroku
- much more
